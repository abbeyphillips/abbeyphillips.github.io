        <br>

        <p> The first thing I paid attention to is the time and weather input as both were accurate but once I refreshed
            a
            few times, I realised that the weather is randomised from rainy, windy, cloudy, foggy, or sunny. </p>

        <h1>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h1>
        <br>
        <p> I spend the most time engaging with the adventure game element of the website as the narrative continued for
            significantly longer than I had expected, which was intriguing and made me want to persist until the end.
        </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most common action was clicking buttons to resume revealing the storyline, along with exploring the
            webpage to learn about and interact with all of the characters - including my own.

        <h1> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? </h1>
        <br>
        <p> The primary goal of the interactive experience was to produce an adventure game guided by the user’s
            preferences, which can control the entire outcome of the narrative, ranging from the names of the characters
            to how they behave. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h1>
        <br>
        <p> Goodbye.Monster is a text-based interactive experience and utilises symbols and buttons to portray the plot.
            Despite not having many visuals, the neon colours and endless display of buttons to click retain the user’s
            attention, while the unique nature is fascinating. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how
            many
            different times) </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The game could be replayed by selecting different buttons to change the storyline; however the experience is
            significantly less entertaining once you’ve refreshed it several times and are already familiar with the
            outcomes. Most users probably wouldn’t revisit the website frequently, but the developers could replace the
            buttons and create a new narrative to increase the incentive to play again. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with
            over
            time? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Since the game doesn’t convey that the website will be updated or changed, users aren’t enticed to revisit it
            regularly. </p>

        <h1> What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>During my first interaction with Goodbye.Monster, I was reminded of the online video games <i>Runescape</i> and
            <i>AdventureQuest</i> as they are all fantasy exploration games based on completing tasks to level up.
            Goodbye.Monster
            is also similar to the app <i>Episode</i>, which frequently used to be advertised on Instagram featuring stories
            with
            prompts like ‘He is so cute!’ (What’s his story?) or (Kiss him!).
            <br><br>
            The website is reminiscent of the tv shows <i>Love Island</i>and <i>Kaleidoscope.</i> Viewers of the reality dating show
            <i>Love
            Island</i> are able to download an app and make choices that impact the cast members in real time, such as
            voting
            who should be ‘kicked out’. Netflix’s <i>Kaleidoscope</i> is a heist show whereby viewers can watch the episodes in
            any
            sequence and it will still make sense.
            <br><br>
            Although there is no direct correlation between the two, Goodbye.Monster has a similar vibe to the
            collection of
            short horror stories titled <i>The Trees Grew Because I Bled There</i> by Eric LaRocca. The interactive experience
            isn’t necessarily outright scary, but there is a creepy atmosphere created by the unusual names and the
            storyline, where the creature is slowly being destroyed.
        </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The users should fully engage in the experience with a sense of childlike wonder, as the website is redolent
            nostalgic old video games. The eerie music and the unusual storyline should entangle users into the game and
            nudge them to continue playing, much like the creature that is being sucked in and dismantled. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The users should initially feel amused and occupied by the various clickable elements of the experience, and
            as
            the narrative continues to unveil itself, the users should begin to feel a sense of discomfort caused by the
            unusual display. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most frustrating part of the interaction involves being unable to proceed with the game at certain
            sections because a specific element needed to be clicked on. When this occurred, I was unsure if the entire
            website needed to be refreshed in order to continue and it was dissatisfying. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most satisfying part of the interaction is the buttons, since all of them produce a result when they were
            clicked on. Due to this element, the game requires user interaction to operate so there was constantly
            stimulation throughout the experience. </p>

        <h1> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h1>
        <br>
        <p> Initially, I was intrigued by the ‘sent me a letter’ component of the webpage because it makes me nostalgic of the Pictochat App on Nintendo DS, where users could communicate by sketching to each other. I was also entertained by the (on/off) buttons and I was curious to see whether it would make a change to the webpage. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </h1>
        <br>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the ‘write me a letter’ element</li>
                <li>Exit the image to show different images</li>
                <li>Click all the check buttons</li>
                <li>View more projects</li>
                <li>Use the slider bar to change the angle of the lines</li>
                <li>Exit all the elements until the webpage is empty</li>
                <li>Refresh page</li>
            </ol>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h1>
        <br>
        <p> I spent the most time engaging with the delete buttons on each of the components until they had all disappeared and the website had to be refreshed to view the experience again.  </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most common action would be clicking to open and close different components, as most of the external links could only be accessed by clicking or exiting them.  </p>

     </section>

        <h1> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The website successfully presents Max Bittker with all of the necessary information about his career as a developer and artist, including Sandspiel and @NYT_first_said, while ensuring that it is an entertaining experience for the user. The ‘Send me a letter’ component allows users to interact with Max Bittker in a fun and engaging way, and the entire webpage can be altered and deleted by users, which emphasises his creativity and makes a mere personal website, a stimulating interactive experience.  </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The interactive experience is a personal website designed to promote Max Bittker and provides links and images to his blog, previous projects, and social media. The objective is to give all users, whether they’re artists, designers, students, or potential employers, an insight into who he is.  </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The website probably wouldn’t be interacted with frequently by the same users, as the information will likely only be updated when Max Bittker publishes a new project. Since most of the webpage leads to external links and letters cannot be sent back to users, the experience won’t be interacted with for long period of time. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Since the interactive experience doesn’t convey that the website will be updated or changed, users aren’t enticed to revisit it regularly.  </p>

    </section>

        <div id="project02"></div>

        <h1> What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Max Bittker’s website is reminiscent of a video game, where users can adjust the composition of the game and ultimately ending up with a blank screen that needs to be refreshed in order to restart.  </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The users should act recklessly as the interactive experience is presented as light-hearted and amusing like a video game, rather than something serious and profound like a newspaper. The buttons can be ticked and then unticked, the intensity of the squares surrounding each component can be softened, and all of it can be deleted. Additionally, the images attached to the website are informal considering that is it a personal website, which contributes to the relaxed atmosphere. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The users should feel entertained and satisfied when navigating through the experience, as they are given the freedom to interfere with the integrity of the website, which is uncommon on most other networks and usually aimed to prevent from occurring. This amused feeling is comparable to when users are playing a video game and are able to act recklessly in another world, despite this behaviour being deemed socially unacceptable outside of the game.  </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most frustrating element was the check buttons as there was no response or feedback given when they had all been ticked or unticked, which made it slightly unsatisfying. Additionally, the misalignment and chaotic placement of the components and the lines surrounding them makes the website look jumbled, though it contributes to the overall style. </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h1> What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The most satisfying element was the exit buttons as they allow users to change and remove each of the components and destroy the integrity of the website.  </p>
